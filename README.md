# Applets
Simple scripts, the folders are full-fledged applets, but the single python files are single purpose scripts.

# Path.py
Lists all the files by size given a directory and a csv file to print to.

"Usage: python3 path.py <directory_to_list_from> <csv_file_to_print_to>"

ex:
python3 path.py ../lists file_list.csv


# Sudoku Solver
A python implementation for a sudoku solver. All the boards are represented properly in the boards folder. Just simply pick the board of your choosing and run the program! The harder puzzles take a little longer, but they are all solvable


# Five-Twelve
A psuedo implementation of the classic tile game 2048. It is run by executing the game engine. Unfortunately you must click on the window for the game to start, but after that you can navigate the game simply with just arrows.



--- Each Folder will have its own README with proper documentation for execution ---

# Applets
A small respository for a few python applets I have worked on in the past. 

# Sudoku Solver
A python implementation for a sudoku solver. All the boards are represented properly in the boards folder. Just simply pick the board of your choosing and run the program! The harder puzzles take a little longer, but they are all solvable

# Five-Twelve
A psuedo implementation of the classic tile game 2048. It is run by executing the game engine. Unfortunately you must click on the window for the game to start, but after that you can navigate the game simply with just arrows.


--- Each Folder will have its own README with proper documentation for execution ---
